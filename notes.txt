1. After setting up template repo, do npm install to be able to run commands
2. I commented out reset.css for now since tailwind seems to do the same job and more
3. Install the required packages for tailwind (with webpack specifically)
    npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p <- generating the tailwind config
4. Configure tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
    content: [
        "./src/**/*.{html,js}",   // adjust if your files are elsewhere
    ],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    };
5. Add Tailwind to yocur CSS entry file
    If your CSS file is at src/assets/style.css

    Replace its content with:

    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
6. Update postcss.config.js
    module.exports = {
        plugins: {
            tailwindcss: {},
            autoprefixer: {},
        },
    };
7. Make sure webpack loads postcss ("postcss-loader")
8. Dev and Build commands, then it should work
9. import style.css in a file component later, which you might import into index

*** different install commands for tailwind v4 which no longer uses CLI commands, PostCSS, etc. ***
@import "tailwindcss"; automatically handles everything for you
which is why for this task I stuck with tailwind v3 to allow compatibility with webpack
